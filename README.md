## Overview

The MetaGPT Builder is a complete AI system that builds other AI systems. Instead of the typical "write some instructions and hope" approach, this system guides users through proper knowledge architecture to create Custom GPTs and Claude Projects that actually work in production.

**Key Innovation:** Treats AI projects as knowledge systems rather than chatbots, using retrieval optimization, structured metadata, and maintenance protocols.

**Platform Optimization Innovation:** Features hybrid architecture for Custom GPTs that maintains full sophisticated functionality within platform constraints, demonstrating advanced optimization expertise.

### What Makes This Different

- **Architecture-First:** Focus on knowledge structure, not just prompts
- **Platform-Optimized:** Full functionality on both Claude Projects and Custom GPTs
- **Hybrid Architecture:** Solves Custom GPT's 8K character limit intelligently
- **Production-Ready:** Includes maintenance SOPs, testing protocols, version control
- **Multi-Project Systems:** Design for scale from the start
- **Battle-Tested:** Built from 40+ hours of real-world AI project development

## How It Works

### The Process
1. **Discovery:** 8-step guided conversation to understand requirements
2. **Architecture:** System designs optimal file structure and metadata
3. **Generation:** Creates complete deployment package
4. **Implementation:** Platform-specific setup guides
5. **Validation:** Testing protocols ensure quality

### Key Technologies
- **9-Field Metadata Schema:** Precise retrieval optimization
- **Two-Layer Prompt Architecture:** Base behaviors + project specifics  
- **Chunking Strategy:** 600-1000 token optimization
- **Maintenance Protocols:** Keep systems accurate over time

### What You Get
- Complete system prompts (behavioral layer)
- Structured knowledge bases with metadata (information layer)
- Maintenance procedures (longevity layer)
- Test suites (quality layer)
- Platform-specific deployment guides
