## Overview

The MetaGPT Builder is a complete AI system that builds other AI systems. Instead of the typical "write some instructions and hope" approach, this system guides users through proper knowledge architecture to create Custom GPTs and Claude Projects that actually work in production.

**Key Innovation:** Treats AI projects as knowledge systems rather than chatbots, using retrieval optimization, structured metadata, and maintenance protocols.

### What Makes This Different

- **Architecture-First:** Focus on knowledge structure, not just prompts
- **Production-Ready:** Includes maintenance SOPs, testing protocols, version control
- **Multi-Project Systems:** Design for scale from the start
- **Battle-Tested:** Built from 40+ hours of real-world AI project development

---

## How It Works

### The Process
1. **Discovery:** 8-step guided conversation to understand requirements
2. **Architecture:** System designs optimal file structure and metadata
3. **Generation:** Creates complete deployment package
4. **Implementation:** Platform-specific setup guides
5. **Validation:** Testing protocols ensure quality

### Key Technologies
- **9-Field Metadata Schema:** Precise retrieval optimization
- **Two-Layer Prompt Architecture:** Base behaviors + project specifics  
- **Chunking Strategy:** 600-1000 token optimization
- **Maintenance Protocols:** Keep systems accurate over time

### What You Get
- Complete system prompts (behavioral layer)
- Structured knowledge bases with metadata (information layer)
- Maintenance procedures (longevity layer)
- Test suites (quality layer)
- Platform-specific deployment guides

---

## System Capabilities

The MetaGPT Builder can create:

### Single-Project Systems
- **Customer Support GPTs** with FAQ integration
- **Content Creation Assistants** with brand voice
- **Technical Documentation** systems
- **Educational Tutors** with structured curriculum

### Multi-Project Architectures
- **Universal Knowledge Base** shared across projects
- **Lens Documents** for project-specific views
- **Coordinated Systems** with handoff protocols
- **Scalable Maintenance** across multiple projects

---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Knowledge Architecture:** RAG-like precision without engineering
- **Retrieval Optimization:** 9-field metadata ensures right content surfaces
- **Behavioral Protocols:** Error handling, maintenance modes, data freshness
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Works with both OpenAI and Anthropic

### File Structure Logic
**Why Two Prompt Files?**
- `BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`: Universal behaviors (reused in multi-project systems)
- `PROJECT_PROMPT_*.md`: Project-specific instructions
- **Platform Implementation:** Both get pasted into single Instructions field
- **Maintenance Advantage:** Update shared behaviors once, deploy everywhere
