# 1. WHAT IS THE METAGPT BUILDER?

The MetaGPT Builder is an AI-powered system that helps you create effective Custom GPTs (OpenAI) and Claude Projects (Anthropic) using a sophisticated knowledge architecture framework.

## The Problem It Solves

Most people building GPTs or Claude Projects write some instructions, upload a few files, and hope for the best. The result often:
- Retrieves wrong information for queries
- Gives inconsistent answers
- Forgets important context
- Degrades over time as knowledge becomes stale
- Has no clear path for updates or improvements

## The Solution

The MetaGPT Builder treats your AI project as a **knowledge system**, not just a chatbot with instructions. It helps you:

- **Structure knowledge for retrieval** — Your content is organized so the right information surfaces for the right queries
- **Design behavioral protocols** — Your project knows how to handle uncertainty, errors, and edge cases
- **Plan for maintenance** — Built-in procedures for updates, version control, and quality assurance
- **Scale appropriately** — From simple single-purpose tools to complex multi-project systems

## What You Get

When you build with the MetaGPT Builder, you receive:

| Deliverable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| System Prompt(s) | Instructions that define your project's behavior |
| Master Intelligence Brief (MIB) | Your core knowledge document — properly chunked with metadata |
| File Map | Architecture reference showing what goes where |
| Maintenance SOP | Procedures for updating your project |
| Changelog | Version history tracking |
| Test Suite | Validation tests to verify your project works correctly |
| Implementation Guide | Step-by-step deployment instructions |
| (Optional) Lens Documents | For multi-project systems with shared knowledge |

# 2. WHO IS THIS FOR?

## Good Fit

- **Founders & Business Owners** — Building AI tools for your business operations
- **Consultants & Agencies** — Creating AI solutions for clients
- **Team Leads & Managers** — Building tools for your team
- **Operators** — Systematizing processes and workflows
- **Anyone building AI projects** — Who wants them to actually work well

## You Don't Need To Be Technical

The MetaGPT Builder guides you through the process with questions, not code. If you can describe what you want your project to do, you can build with this system.

## What You Should Have Ready

Before starting, it helps to have:
- A clear idea of what you want your project to accomplish
- Any existing documents, data, or expertise you want it to use
- Knowledge of who will use the finished project

**Don't have existing documents?** That's completely fine. Many successful projects start from scratch. The Builder offers three methods to build your knowledge base:

1. **Deep Research** — Use AI research tools to gather domain knowledge
2. **Self-Interview** — Extract the expertise from your head through structured questioning
3. **Hybrid Approach** — Combine research for fundamentals with self-interview for your specific expertise

The Builder will guide you through whichever approach fits your situation.

**Don't worry if your knowledge base isn't complete** — the Builder accommodates phased approaches where you start lean and expand over time. You can launch with a "Minimum Viable Knowledge Base" and grow it based on actual usage.

---

# 3. KEY CONCEPTS

## Knowledge System vs. Chatbot

A **chatbot** has instructions and maybe some uploaded files. It answers questions as best it can.

A **knowledge system** has:
- Structured content optimized for retrieval
- Behavioral protocols for handling different situations
- Maintenance procedures for staying current
- Clear documentation for updates and handoffs

The MetaGPT Builder creates knowledge systems.

## Chunking

Large documents don't retrieve well. "Chunking" means breaking content into optimal segments (600-1000 tokens each) that can be retrieved independently while maintaining context.

The Builder structures your knowledge with proper chunking so queries surface relevant information — not random fragments or entire documents.

## Single-Project vs. Multi-Project

**Single-Project:** One GPT or Claude Project with its own self-contained knowledge. Simpler to build and maintain.

**Multi-Project System:** Multiple related projects sharing common knowledge. Each project has its own "lens" — a view into the shared knowledge base tailored to its specific purpose.

Example: A consulting business might have separate projects for Business Strategy, Content Creation, and Client Onboarding — all drawing from the same market intelligence and methodology documentation.

## Maintenance Mode

Your project includes a "maintenance mode" that activates when you need to update its knowledge base. This separates normal usage (getting work done) from administrative tasks (keeping the system current).

---

# 4. GETTING STARTED: YOUR FIRST PROJECT

## Step 1: Start a Conversation

Open the MetaGPT Builder and describe what you want to build. You can be as specific or general as you like:

**Simple:**
> "I want to build a GPT that helps with customer support for my software product."

**Detailed:**
> "I need a Claude Project for my consulting business that helps me create proposals. It should know our service offerings, pricing tiers, and case studies, and output professional proposal documents."

## Step 2: Answer Discovery Questions

The Builder will ask you a series of questions to understand your needs. This typically takes 5-10 minutes and covers:

1. **Scale** — Single project or multi-project system?
2. **Context** — Who's involved? What's your starting point? What stage is this?
3. **Purpose** — What's the primary job? What does success look like?
4. **Audience** — Who will use it? What's their level?
5. **Knowledge** — What content should it have? Is it complete or will you expand it?
6. **Behavior** — What tone? What formats? Any constraints?
7. **Agent Type** — The Builder determines what type of agent you're creating
8. **Platform** — Claude Project, Custom GPT, or both?

**Tips for Discovery:**
- Be honest about gaps — "I don't know yet" is a valid answer
- Mention if you're learning as you go — the Builder adapts
- Share constraints upfront — budget, timeline, technical limits
- **Share your content** — During discovery, you can provide existing documents, templates, or data. The Builder will chunk and structure this content with proper metadata for optimal retrieval. You don't have to do the knowledge architecture yourself.

## Step 3: Review the Architecture

Before generating documents, the Builder presents a proposed architecture:

```
PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE: Single Project

Files to create:
1. SYSTEM_PROMPT.md — Combined base + project instructions
2. CUSTOMER_SUPPORT_KB.md — Main knowledge document  
3. MAINTENANCE_SOP.md — Update procedures
4. CHANGELOG.md — Version tracking

Platform: Claude Project
Agent Type: Support/Communication + Information Retrieval

Shall I proceed with this structure?
```

Review this carefully. Ask questions. Request changes if something doesn't fit.

## Step 4: Receive Your Deliverables

Once you approve, the Builder generates all documents:

- Complete, copy-paste ready
- Properly structured for retrieval
- With behavioral protocols built in
- Including maintenance procedures

Each document is ready to use — no placeholders, no "add content here" sections.

## Step 5: Deploy

The Builder provides platform-specific implementation instructions telling you exactly where to paste and upload each file.

---

# 5. THE DISCOVERY PROCESS

Discovery is the most important phase. The Builder asks questions before building because:

- **Assumptions waste time** — Wrong assumptions mean rebuilding later
- **Context shapes architecture** — Your situation affects the right approach
- **Gaps surface early** — Better to identify missing pieces before building

## The Eight Discovery Steps

### Step 1: Scale
*"Is this a single GPT/Project, or a system of multiple related projects?"*

This shapes everything. Multi-project systems need shared knowledge architecture, lens documents, and sync protocols. Single projects are simpler.

### Step 2: Context Assessment
*"Tell me about your situation..."*

The Builder asks about:
- **Who's involved** — Just you? Team? Clients?
- **Your starting point** — Expert? Learning? Organizing existing docs?
- **Project stage** — Prototype? Production-ready?

This calibrates documentation depth, architecture complexity, and polish level.

### Step 3: Purpose & Goals
*"What is the primary job this needs to do?"*

Clear purpose = clear architecture. The Builder also asks what it should NOT do — boundaries matter.

### Step 4: Target Audience
*"Who will use this?"*

End users' expertise level affects tone, terminology, and how much the project explains vs. assumes.

### Step 5: Knowledge Sources
*"What documents, data, or expertise should it have?"*

The Builder asks what exists vs. what needs creation, and whether you plan to expand the knowledge over time.

### Step 6: Behavioral Requirements
*"What tone and style?"*

Communication style, output formats, and any topics or actions that are off-limits.

### Step 7: Agent Type
The Builder determines your project's classification (e.g., Support/Communication, Content Creation, Strategy/Advisory) and explains the behavioral implications.

### Step 8: Platform
*"Claude Project, Custom GPT, or both?"*

Different platforms have different strengths and setup procedures.

# 6. UNDERSTANDING YOUR OUTPUTS

## System Prompt

The instructions that define your project's behavior. Contains:

- **Core Identity** — Who the assistant is, its expertise, its approach
- **Retrieval Configuration** — How it uses the knowledge base
- **Data Freshness Protocol** — How it handles potentially stale information
- **Confidence Weighting** — How it presents certain vs. uncertain information
- **Spec Confirmation** — When it confirms understanding before generating
- **Error Handling** — What to do when things go wrong
- **Maintenance Mode** — How to update the knowledge base

For single projects, this is one combined prompt. For multi-project systems, there's a base prompt (universal behaviors) and project prompts (specific to each project).

## Master Intelligence Brief (MIB)

Your core knowledge document, structured for retrieval:

- **Chunked** — Broken into optimal segments (600-1000 tokens)
- **With Metadata** — Tagged with 9-field schema for better retrieval targeting
- **With Boundary Overlap** — Context preserved across chunk boundaries
- **Organized** — Clear sections, logical structure, room to grow
- **Appendices** — Statistics consolidated, templates included, glossary for consistency

**Two paths:** If you provided documents during discovery, your MIB comes pre-populated with your content — chunked, tagged with metadata, and organized for retrieval. If you didn't provide content, you receive a template structure to populate yourself before deployment.

## File Map

Architecture reference for your project:

- **Document Inventory** — What files exist, their purposes
- **Setup Instructions** — Exactly where everything goes
- **Folder Structure** — How to organize locally
- **Version Tracking** — Current versions of all documents
- **Maintenance Triggers** — What phrases activate maintenance mode

**Note:** Keep this file locally for your reference. Do not upload it to your project's Knowledge — the GPT/Project doesn't need it to function.

## Maintenance SOP

Procedures for updating your project:

- **Update Types** — Different procedures for different kinds of changes
- **Freshness Thresholds** — When to review different content types
- **Changelog Format** — How to document changes
- **Review Schedule** — Recommended maintenance cadence
- **Phased Expansion** — How to grow your KB over time

## Changelog

Version history tracking:

- What changed
- When it changed
- Why it changed
- What else was affected

## Test Suite

Validation tests to verify your project works:

- **Retrieval Tests** — Does the right content surface for queries?
- **Behavioral Tests** — Does it follow its protocols?
- **Maintenance Trigger Tests** — Does maintenance mode work correctly?
- **Edge Case Tests** — Does it handle unusual situations gracefully?
- **Regression Tests** — Quick checks after any update

**Note:** Keep this file locally. Use it to manually test your project after deployment and after any updates. Do not upload to Knowledge.

## Implementation Guide

Platform-specific deployment instructions:

- Exactly where to paste prompts
- Exactly what to upload
- How to test that it's working

# 8. MAINTAINING YOUR PROJECT

## Why Maintenance Matters

Knowledge decays:
- Market data becomes stale
- Best practices evolve
- Platform features change
- Your business grows and shifts

A project without maintenance becomes increasingly unreliable.

## The Maintenance Mode

Your project has a built-in maintenance mode that activates when you need to update the knowledge base.

**To enter maintenance mode, say things like:**
- "Update the knowledge base"
- "Add to the knowledge base"
- "Maintenance mode"

**This will NOT trigger maintenance mode:**
- "Revise this document" (you're asking for help with YOUR content)
- "Fix this paragraph" (you're working on YOUR writing)
- Anything with "this" or "my" referring to your work

When ambiguous, the project will ask for clarification.

## Update Types

| Type | When to Use | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|------------|
| STAT_UPDATE | A number or statistic changed | Low |
| INSIGHT_ADD | New information within existing topic | Low-Medium |
| SECTION_ADD | Entirely new topic area | Medium |
| CORRECTION | Something is factually wrong | Low |
| SUPERSEDE | Old information is no longer valid | Medium-High |
| MAJOR_REVISION | Significant restructure needed | High |

Each type has specific procedures in your MAINTENANCE_SOP.md.

## Freshness Review Schedule

| Content Type | Review Frequency |
|--------------|------------------|
| Market data, statistics | Every 6 months |
| Industry trends | Every 12 months |
| Platform features | Every 6 months |
| Core concepts, definitions | Rarely (evergreen) |

## Keeping the Changelog

Every update should be logged:

```
| Date | What Changed | Type | Notes |
|------|--------------|------|-------|
| 2025-03-15 | Updated pricing section | STAT_UPDATE | New Q1 rates |
| 2025-02-01 | Added competitor analysis | SECTION_ADD | New section 7 |
```

This history helps you:
- Track what changed and when
- Understand why something works (or doesn't)
- Hand off to others if needed
- Roll back if updates cause problems

## Building From Zero (No Existing Documents)

If you don't have existing documentation, the Builder offers three methods to create your knowledge base:

### Method 1: Deep Research

Use AI research tools (Claude with web search, ChatGPT with browsing, Perplexity) to gather domain knowledge. The Builder provides a customized research prompt.

**Best for:** Industry best practices, regulatory requirements, standard procedures, foundational knowledge.

**Process:** Research broadly → Identify gaps → Research deeply → Customize with your specifics → Structure for retrieval.

### Method 2: Self-Interview

The Builder provides a prompt that turns an AI into your interviewer, extracting the expertise from your head through structured questioning.

**Best for:** Your specific processes, decision-making frameworks, lessons learned, policies, pricing, preferences.

**Process:** 60-90 minute interview → Transcript → Convert to structured KB content.

### Method 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

Combine both approaches:
1. Research domain fundamentals (1-2 hours)
2. Self-interview for your specific expertise (1-2 hours)
3. Merge and structure (1-2 hours)

**Best for:** Comprehensive knowledge bases that blend industry knowledge with your specific approach.

When you tell the Builder "I don't have documents," it will guide you through choosing and executing the right approach.

## Phased Expansion

Your knowledge base doesn't need to be complete on day one. Plan for growth:

### The Minimum Viable Knowledge Base (MVKB)

Launch with:
- Core purpose content (what it MUST know)
- Top 10 most common questions/tasks
- Key constraints and guardrails
- Basic error handling

### The Four Phases

| Phase | Goal | Timing | Size |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| **Launch** | Get something working | Week 1 | 10-20 chunks |
| **Fill Gaps** | Address what's missing | Weeks 2-4 | 20-35 chunks |
| **Deepen** | Improve quality | Month 2-3 | 35-50 chunks |
| **Expand** | Broaden coverage | Month 3+ | 50+ chunks |

### Identifying Gaps

Watch for these signals:
- Project says "I don't have information about..." → Content gap
- Wrong information surfaces → Chunking/metadata issue
- Answers are partial → Content needs deepening
- Users rephrase repeatedly → Metadata needs keywords

Track gaps, review monthly, batch updates together.

# 9. ADVANCED: MULTI-PROJECT SYSTEMS

## When to Use Multi-Project

Consider a multi-project system when:

- Multiple tools need the same core knowledge
- Different audiences need different views of the same information
- You want consistent behavior across related projects
- You anticipate adding more related tools over time

## How It Works

**Universal Documents** — Shared by ALL projects:
- Master knowledge document (your core intelligence)
- Base system prompt (universal behaviors)
- Maintenance SOP (update procedures)

**Shared Documents** — Used by SOME projects:
- Style guides
- Templates
- Reference materials

**Project-Specific Documents** — Unique to each project:
- Lens document (that project's view into shared knowledge)
- Project prompt (that project's specific instructions)

## Lens Documents

A lens document tells a specific project:
- Which parts of the shared knowledge are most relevant
- How to weight different sections
- How to apply the knowledge for this project's purpose
- What behavioral adjustments to make

Example: A "Content Creation" project and a "Sales Outreach" project might share the same market intelligence, but the Content lens emphasizes thought leadership angles while the Sales lens emphasizes pain points and objections.

## Sync Management

When you update a universal or shared document, changes must propagate to all affected projects:

1. Update the source document
2. Re-upload to all projects that use it
3. Log the update in each project's changelog

Your MAINTENANCE_SOP includes sync procedures and a matrix showing which documents go to which projects.

# 10. TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQs

## Common Issues

### "It's not retrieving the right information"

**Possible causes:**
- Content isn't chunked well (sections too long or too short)
- Query doesn't match how content is written
- Retrieval isolation is blocking content

**Solutions:**
- Review knowledge base structure
- Try different query phrasings
- Check if content is in a quarantined section (like MAINTENANCE_SOP)

### "It's not following the instructions"

**Possible causes:**
- Instructions are too long (platforms may truncate)
- Conflicting instructions
- Instructions are vague

**Solutions:**
- Prioritize critical instructions early
- Remove contradictions
- Make instructions specific and actionable

### "It triggered maintenance mode when I didn't want it"

**Cause:** Ambiguous language that could mean updating KB or working on content

**Solution:** Use "this" or "my" when referring to your own work:
- ✅ "Help me revise this document"
- ❌ "Revise the document" (ambiguous)

### "I'm not sure if my knowledge base is good enough"

**Answer:** Start with what you have. The Builder structures your project to accommodate growth. You can always add more content later using INSIGHT_ADD and SECTION_ADD procedures.

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to be technical to use this?**
A: No. The Builder guides you through with questions. If you can describe what you want, you can build it.

**Q: What if I don't have any existing documents?**
A: No problem! The Builder offers three methods to create your knowledge base from scratch: Deep Research (using AI to gather domain knowledge), Self-Interview (extracting expertise from your head), or a Hybrid approach combining both. Just tell the Builder "I don't have documents" and it will guide you.

**Q: How long does it take to build a project?**
A: Simple projects with existing content: 30-60 minutes. Projects starting from scratch (with research/interview): 3-5 hours total. Complex multi-project systems: 4-8 hours.

**Q: Can I build for both Claude and GPT?**
A: Yes. Tell the Builder you need both, and it will provide platform-specific implementations.

**Q: What if my knowledge base isn't complete?**
A: That's fine — and often intentional. The Builder supports "Minimum Viable Knowledge Base" launches where you start with core content and expand based on actual usage. You'll get gap identification signals and expansion procedures.

**Q: How do I know what to include in my initial knowledge base?**
A: Focus on: core purpose content (what it MUST know), top 10 most common questions/tasks, key constraints, and basic error handling. Defer edge cases and nice-to-haves for later phases.

**Q: How do I expand my knowledge base over time?**
A: Track gaps as you use the project (queries that fail, questions you answer manually). Review monthly, batch similar additions, use INSIGHT_ADD for expanding existing topics and SECTION_ADD for new areas. The Builder provides a complete phased expansion framework.

**Q: How often should I update my project?**
A: Depends on your content. Market data: every 6 months. Core concepts: rarely. The MAINTENANCE_SOP includes recommended schedules.

**Q: Can I modify the outputs?**
A: Absolutely. The deliverables are starting points. Customize to fit your needs — just maintain the structural principles for best results.

**Q: What if I want to change the architecture later?**
A: You can evolve from single to multi-project, or restructure as needed. Major changes use the MAJOR_REVISION procedure.

**Q: What files will I receive?**
A: For a typical single project: System Prompt, Master Intelligence Brief (your KB), File Map, Maintenance SOP, Changelog, Test Suite, and Implementation Guide. Multi-project systems also include a Base System Prompt, Project Prompts, and Lens Documents.

**Q: How do I ask the Builder for help using itself?**
A: Just ask! Say "How do you work?" or "Walk me through this" and the Builder will explain itself or guide you step-by-step.
